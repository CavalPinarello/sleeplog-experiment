## 📊 7 Health Categories

Each day, users rate these areas on a 1-10 scale:

1. **Sleep Quality** - Overall sleep assessment
2. **Bedroom Environment** - Comfort of sleeping space
3. **Mental Health** - Emotional well-being
4. **Cognitive Health** - Mental clarity and focus
5. **Memory** - Memory function assessment
6. **Diet** - Eating habits evaluation
7. **Nutrition** - Nutritional quality of food

Plus optional notes for additional observations.
