## Viewing Tasks in Linear

All tasks are under the **SleepLogExperiment** project:

Filter by assignee:
- **Martin's tasks:** Assigned to you
- **Droid's tasks:** Unassigned

## About Droid & Parallel Processing

**Question:** Are you using multiple parallel agents?

**Answer:** No, I'm a single AI assistant (Droid). However, I can:
- Execute multiple tool calls in parallel (API calls, file operations)
- Work very efficiently by planning ahead
- Process requests quickly

There's just one me! ðŸ˜Š When tasks are "assigned to Droid," that means I'll complete them as you work through your manual testing tasks.

## Next Steps

1. **Martin:** Start with SLE-20 (Start Backend Server)
2. **Martin:** Work through SLE-21 to SLE-30 in order
3. **Droid:** Monitor progress and document results (SLE-31)
4. **Droid:** Fix any bugs immediately (SLE-36)
5. **Droid:** Create final documentation (SLE-32, SLE-33, SLE-34)
6. **Droid:** Prepare for error handling phase (SLE-35)
