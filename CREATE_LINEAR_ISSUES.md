# Quick Guide: Creating Linear Issues for This Project

## All Tasks Documented

I've created a comprehensive task breakdown in `.github/LINEAR_TASKS.md` with 15 tasks organized into 2 phases.

## How to Create Linear Issues

Since you have Linear integrated, here are the easiest ways to create issues:

### Method 1: Use This Prompt with Droid

Simply say to Droid:

```
"Create Linear issues for all pending tasks from .github/LINEAR_TASKS.md"
```

Droid will create issues for:
- Task 11: End-to-End Testing
- Task 12: Add Error Handling  
- Task 13: Add Data Export Feature
- Task 14: Add Data Visualization Charts
- Task 15: Deployment Setup

### Method 2: Copy-Paste Template

For each task in `.github/LINEAR_TASKS.md`, use this format in Linear:

**Title:** [Task Name]

**Description:**
```
[Task Description from LINEAR_TASKS.md]

Labels: [labels]
Priority: [priority]
Estimate: [hours]
```

### Example Linear Issue

**Title:** End-to-End Testing

**Description:**
```
Test complete user workflow including:
- Session persistence across page refreshes
- All API endpoints functionality
- Data storage in SQLite database
- Responsive design on mobile devices

Labels: testing, qa
Priority: High
Estimate: 3 hours
```

## Alternative: Ask Droid to Create Issues

You can ask Droid:

```

or

```
"Create all pending Linear issues from the task list"
```

Droid will use the Linear API to create properly structured issues with all the details from `LINEAR_TASKS.md`.

## After Creating Issues

Once issues are created in Linear:

1. **Link commits:** Reference Linear issue IDs in commits
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add CSV export feature (PROJECT-123)"
   ```

2. **Track progress:** Update issue status in Linear as you work

3. **Ask Droid:** 
   ```
   "Show me all open Linear issues for this project"
   "Mark Linear issue PROJECT-123 as complete"
   ```

---

## Next Action

**Recommended:** Ask Droid to create the Linear issues:

```
"Create Linear issues for the 5 pending tasks from LINEAR_TASKS.md"
```

Droid will handle creating properly formatted issues in your Linear workspace!
